        <h4>Why can't I connect bzShare?</h4>
        <p>First, you could not have asked this question if you see this in the first place.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The network connection is lost or interrupted. Please check your network connection and proxy settings before you try again.</li>
            <li>Your web browser is too old to use bzShare.</li>
            <li>The local firewall had prevented you from visiting bzShare. We cannot help and we do not offer to help these kinds of problems.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Why can't I use bzShare?</h4>
        <p>These are a set of problems related to the deprecation of obsolete web browsers. Consider updating your web browsers in order to fix these problems.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your web browser does not support JavaScript or you turned it off.</li>
            <li>Your web browser does not support CSS3.</li>
            <li>Your web browser does not support HTML5.</li>
            <li>You have an IE6. <b>:)</b></li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Supported Browsers</h4>
        <p>Having at least these versions of browsers enable your enhanced experience of bzShare. Older versions have not been tested, but should at least work.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mozilla Firefox 37.0+ <a href="https://download.mozilla.org/?product=firefox-latest">Download</a></li>
            <li>Google Chrome 43.0+ <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome">Download</a></li>
            <li>Apple Safari 5+ <a href="https://www.apple.com/safari">Download</a></li>
            <li>Opera 12.17+ (EOL)</li>
            <li><del>Internet Explorer 11+</del> (Partial dysfunction)</li>
            <li><b style="color: #880000;">We strongly advise you against using '<del>Safe</del> Browsers' that incorporate IE6 kernels.</b></li>

        <h4>Why can't I upload anything?</h4>
        <p>This might be a result of a great many reasons. If you cannot find the correct answer, please contact server administrator directly or consult the developer on GitHub.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The network connection is lost or interrupted.</li>
            <li>You do not have the permissions to write to the current folder. There is no solution to this problem, and please upload the file somewhere else.</li>
            <li>The file itself is too large to be uploaded. Please consider compressing it to smaller chunks with compression softwares (e.g. <a href="http://7-zip.org">7-Zip</a>) and then upload to bzShare.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Why can't I open something in bzShare?</h4>
        <p>It might be a result of network latency. By default bzShare would not allow a user to see anything that he would not be allowed to see, in any way.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The network connection is lost or interrupted. Try refreshing the page to reset the webpage and then check if the open operation works.</li>
            <li>Your web browser is too old to use bzShare. If you cannot decide what version to choose, please view the related sections of FAQ.</li>
            <li>Your computer is too laggy to open the file. Try downloading this somewhere else, then check whether you are able to open this file.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Why can't I rename something in bzShare?</h4>
        <p>This is a combination of problems.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The network connection is lost or interrupted.</li>
            <li>You do not have RW (Read / Write) permissions to this very file / folder.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Why can't I move or delete something in bzShare?</h4>
        <p>This is also a combination of problems.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The network connection is lost or interrupted.</li>
            <li>You do not have full RW (Read / Write) permissions of this file / folder and its subcontents. You may not move or delete if you do not have these permissions, even though you can read them.</li>

        <h4>Why can't I preview this file in bzShare?</h4>
        <p>This is a typical problem which can be invoked in bzShare.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>bzShare had not yet been designed to implement a preview method for this type of file. In this case, you should download it to your device and view it elsewhere.</li>
            <li>On iPhones, iPads and other iOS devices, you would be able to preview <i>Office (*.doc, *.docx, *.ppt, *.pptx, *.xls, *.xlsx, etc.)</i> by clicking 'Download' button. This directly saves the file to the temporary area where you will be able to preview it.</li>
            <li>In the case that you are sure this is a type that bzShare can handle, consult other sections to see the details of the corresponding file type.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Why can't I preview this image in bzShare?</h4>
        <p>This is a typical problem which can be invoked in bzShare.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your web browser do not meet the browser standards of bzShare.</li>
            <li>The connection to the remote server has been interrupted.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Why can't I preview this PDF document in bzShare?</h4>
        <p>This is a typical problem which can be invoked in bzShare.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Check the diagnosis in 'Why can't I preview this image in bzShare' first.</li>
            <li>The PDF file uploaded might be damaged or corrupted.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Why can't I preview this video in bzShare?</h4>
        <p>This is a typical problem which can be invoked in bzShare.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Check the diagnosis in 'Why can't I preview this PDF document in bzShare' first.</li>
            <li>The video has an obstruse format that few people can decode.</li>
            <li>The previewing of videos is related to the native support of the browser. Different browsers on different platforms may act differently to video previews, and since this differs greatly, we suggest that you give up previewing videos on bzShare, elsewise consult the documentation of the corresponding operating system and browser for further information that we cannot provide.</li>

        <a data-toggle="collapse" href="#faq-box-account"><div class="box-header">
            <h4 class="box-title pull-left">Account Related</h4>
        </div></a>
        <div id="faq-box-account" class="panel-collapse collapse collapsed in">
        <div class="box-body">
        <h4>Why can't I create an account?</h4>
        <p>There are a certain limitations on the parameters while creating the account.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To avoid alien intrusion and potential DDoS, unauthorized users' access of the bzShare platform, we implemented an 'invitation code' method, which would block unrelated users from gaining access to most of the bzShare functionalities. People who fail to enter the correct code upon registration would not be able to create the account.</li>
            <li>The length of the user handle that is entered upon login, should not be shorter than 3 characters, and should not be longer than 32 characters. It should also be composed executively of non-capital letters and numerics only ([a-z0-9] as in RegEx).</li>
            <li>The length of the password should not be shorter than 6 characters, and should not be longer than 64 characters. The password should only consist of letters that you can enter with a standard QWERTY / American-101 keyboard.</li>
            <li>You are strongly advised against using common combinations of passwords, as well as passwords that you use in your everyday activities on other websites and services. By doing so you inadvertently expose your data and privacy to unbeknownst people, not excluding the server administrator. We will not take resposibilities for the potential threats and risks, as we explicitly stated.</li>
            <li>The user name should not be shorter than 3 characters, and should not be longer than 32 characters. The user name is what would display on common areas, which could be constructed with arbitrary Unicode characters, excluding a handful of HTML escape characters.</li>
            <li>The description takes similar restrictions as user names, except the length is only bounded by 128 characters merely.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Why can't I change my avatar image?</h4>
        <p>There are also a few limitations on the image.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The file you uploaded must be an image.</li>
            <li>The size of the image should be smaller than 1MB and larger than 68 bytes.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Why can't I sign in?</h4>
        <p>This is an awkward question that you should never ask. Neither do you wish to ask this question.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The username you entered did not exist.</li>
            <li>You have been banned by the server administrator for improper activities.</li>
            <li>The password you had entered is incorrect.</li>
            <li>Somebody else had changed your password elsewhere.</li>
            <li><b>Literally, you had forgotten your password.</b> Ask the server administrator for help on resetting your password by providing your identity information. This action should not be supposed to be done online.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Why am I banned?</h4>
        <p>Mostly, the server administrator does not ban you for no reason.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>For safety of the server and the server administrator, any attempt to post and upload unlegitimate, illegal files and data to the server, would be rightfully rewarded for a constant time of ban.</li>
            <li>You have uploaded something that had caused general dispution and chaos, damaging the reputation of the server and the server administrator, as well as something that considered offensive to particular groups of people.</li>
            <li>You have abused your rights of using bzShare as a normal user, including spamming the server with excessively small files and intensively large files. In other cases you had overflowed the server with computationally-intensive tasks that occupied the server.</li>
            <li>Most unlikely, the administrator just found banning people an interesting thing to do.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="box-body">
        <h4>Why can't I create a usergroup?</h4>
        <p>There are a certain limitations on the parameters while creating the usergroup.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Excluding the server administrator, no account may create more than 3 usergroups.</li>
            <li>The length of the usergroup handle, should not be shorter than 3 characters, and should not be longer than 32 characters. It should also be composed executively of non-capital letters and numerics only ([a-z0-9] as in RegEx).</li>
            <li>The usergroup name should not be shorter than 3 characters, and should not be longer than 32 characters. The usergroup name is what would display on common areas, which could be constructed with arbitrary Unicode characters, excluding a handful of HTML escape characters.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Why can't I join a usergroup?</h4>
        <p>The reason is simple.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Either your network connection is lost or interrupted.</li>
            <li>Or that usergroup didn't even exist.</li>
            <li>In other cases you have already requested to join the usergroup.</li>
            <li>Or you are already a member of that group.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Why can't I accept an account into my group?</h4>
        <p>If you are aware, this question should never have been asked.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your network connection is lost or interrupted.</li>
            <li>Maybe you aren't an owner of that group.</li>
        </ul>
